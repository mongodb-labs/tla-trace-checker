For the recent Intel{\$}^{\{}{\backslash}tiny{\backslash}circledR{\}}{\$}CoreTM i7 design we took a step further and used formal verification as the primary validation vehicle for the core execution cluster, the component responsible for the functional behaviour of all microinstructions. We applied symbolic simulation based formal verification techniques for full datapath, control and state validation for the cluster, and dropped coverage driven testing entirely. The project, involving some twenty person years of verification work, is one of the most ambitious formal verification efforts in the hardware industry to date. Our experiences show that under the right circumstances, full formal verification of a design component is a feasible, industrially viable and competitive validation approach.",

		 approach to strengthen verification and validation
		 techniques for formal co-simulation based wireless

		 framework enables the functionality and protocol
		 algorithms to be encoded in the controller model in the
		 formal Event-B language. Use of proof tools can
		 guarantee safety properties of this formal model. Also,
		 network reliability and performance analysis is
		 performed by MiXiM simulation including e.g. the
		 network load distribution and the network latency.
		 However, this framework lacks focus in validation
		 coverage since test scenarios for the controller model
		 are generated randomly from the simulation environment.
		 Consequently, the MBTT technique is applied to validate
		 the formal Event-B controller in co-models. This
		 technique enables us to create test scenarios from the
		 sequence of events in our co-simulation master
		 algorithm. We use event trace diagrams, fault injection
		 and recovery testing to specify functional, failing and
		 recovery test scenarios. We define MiXiM co-simulation
		 runs to generate long running test scenarios meeting
		 our test requirements. The result shows how failing
		 test scenarios in these runs ({"}killer traces{"})
		 enable model debugging in terms of absent or erroneous
